This is a basic front end example of how I would like to the Toronto DAO business memberships to work

(remember to install the node modules after downloading)

Intended Process

The owner of the business would fill out their Business name, bio, contact number for sales/partnerships and the busines logo.

Holders of the NFT would then have access to the Holders page that would display all of that information for holders to contact each other to list the page

Note: all of this is a front end demo, there is no smart contract, the minting button does not work, the holders page is not gatekept nor are the holders displayed
